# Musicon
In this project, I updated the website of a fictional online musical instruments store, Musicon. 
I incorporated my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a multi-page interactive website.

Musicon has three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. 
The home and store pages already had most of the HTML and CSS set up. My job was to make the following changes:

- Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
- Style the website using your knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
- Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
- Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
