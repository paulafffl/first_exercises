# Wanderlust Project

Using fetch, async, and await, I requested information from the Foursquare API and OpenWeather API to create a travel website.

The following files were provided by Codecademy:
1. helpers.js
1. main.js
1. reset.css
1. style.css
1. index.html

The new pieces of code I wrote was on main.js and helpers.js
