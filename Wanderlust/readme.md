# Wanderlust Project

Using fetch, async, and await, I requested information from the Foursquare API and OpenWeather API to create a travel website.

The following files were provided by Codecademy:
1. helper.js
1. main.js
1. reset.css
1. style.css
1. index.html

I only wrote new pieces of code on main.js.
